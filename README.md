# What Is This?

This is my version of a website for a small startup game development company called Pie On A Plate Productions!! After visiting their websites a few times to check on the progress for one of their games called The Backrooms Game. I deicided to ask the leader of the dev team if I could do a little revamp of their website or if they needed it done. The leader of the dev team gave me the green light so I made this!

# How Did I Make This?

I used the Vue framework to program this site from scratch as I am currently in the process of learning vue, And the vue framework would make programming this website much easier given what I wanted to do as well as make some of the values of the website be able to be edited by changing values.

# Other Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Html
- Sass/Css
- Vue Carousel
- Vue Progress circles


# What Are Some Of The Features Of This Site I made

- Adaptive on multiple screen sizes and viewports of various popular devices
- Completley fluid typography that scales with viewport width
- Scroll enter animations created with a custom vue directive
- A paralax mousemove effect made with javascript
- Reactive data that can be edited to change some content on the page (Could add a cms in the future if the dev team wants to use my website)
